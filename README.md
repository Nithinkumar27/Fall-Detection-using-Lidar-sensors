# Fall detection 

In an aging global population, fall incidents pose a significant risk to the elderly, often resulting in severe consequences. Sudden falls can lead to mental and physical damage to the body, especially in elders, where it can even prove fatal. In this scenario, it becomes vital to detect falls in order to provide instant relief and assistance by notifying the required people. While the initial proposal would be to install cameras in required areas such as old age homes, which would constantly monitor the area for any falls occurring, this poses a privacy issue in high-risk regions such as bathrooms and toilets. Keeping this in mind, this paper proposes the use of LiDAR sensors that do not cause any invasion of privacy for fall detection. The Velodyne VLP-16 Lidar sensor, known for its 100 m range, compact form factor, and 905nm technology, was used for the manual data collection process. The collection of data involved the team performing various poses applicable to the scenarios in which the fall detection model would be used. This collected data was then manually annotated using the Point Processing Toolkit to categorize it into various classes.
